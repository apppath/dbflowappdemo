# DBFlow
DBFlow is a SQLite library for Android that makes it ridiculously easy to interact and use databases. Built with Annotation Processing that generates most of the boilerplate code for you, code use within a DB is fast, efficient, and type-safe. It removes the tedious (and tough-to-maintain) database interaction code.
